# Predicting-Bike-Patterns
In this project, I built a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset!

By building a neural network from the ground up, it gave a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know before we move to higher level tools such as PyTorch. 
I also got to see how to apply these networks to solve real prediction problems!

The data comes from the UCI Machine Learning Database.
